Zoo Managment System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a zoo management program for our zoo (RAF Zoo). This program makes it easier for guests to find out more information about the animals at our zoo.
The program opens up with a login window which allows our guests to continue as guests and our employees to login to use the system for other purposes (coming soon). 
When you enter the system as a guest you will find the welcome screen. This is where you can search for an animal, or see a list of all animals at the zoo. 
**When searching for an animal, names must start with a capital letter.** Once you type a name in and click search, a dialog box will appear and tell you if 
the animal is at our zoo. If the animal is at the zoo, the information for that animal will appear. Also, a list of similar animals will show too. You may 
click on a similar animal if you want to see more information about that particular animal.
